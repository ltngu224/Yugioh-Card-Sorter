# Yugioh-Card-Sorter
Program to pull text from an image of a yugioh card and store it

I wanted to make it easier to keep track of my yugioh card collection. The idea was to use OCR to get the identifying text from an image of a yugioh card and store it in a spreadsheet. This way I can have all of my cards on one document without needing to manually enter them all in.

Currently, it is only ~60% accurate at getting the card names correct and saves them in a .txt file.

This is just me messing around with what I learned in the one MATLAB class I've taken.

## Goals:
- [x] Read the card name
- [ ] Read the set code
- [ ] Read the card edition
- [ ] Save data to a spreadsheet
- [ ] Track number of duplicate cards


#### Potential Features
- Read card type or use name to look up card info
- Capture data from live video or multiple cards in one image
- Look up current card price
